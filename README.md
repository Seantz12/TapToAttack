# TapToAttack
Simplistic mobile game with one button, tap the screen to attack

Has a basic RPG story, I'm designing this game because I wanted a game I could play
with no thought put in, simple controls, but at the same time still "progress" somewhat.
The progression is done in the form of progressing through a story, I also plan on adding
a survival/endless mode for fun.
